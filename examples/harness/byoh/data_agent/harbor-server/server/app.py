"""ASGI entry point for the agentic-rle-fineenvs harness.

Adapted, nearly verbatim, from `openenv.harbor`'s reference server
(`OpenEnv/envs/harbor_env/server/app.py`) — see that project's docs at
`OpenEnv/docs/source/environments/harbor.md` for the full contract this
implements. The only change here is defaulting `OPENENV_DATASETS` to
`FineEnvs/data-agent-harbor-train` so this harness boots pointed at the
Data Agent dataset without extra configuration; every other env var below
still overrides the default the same way it does upstream.

Everything is read from the environment so the same image serves any dataset and any engine without
a rebuild — which is what makes this deployable to a Space:

    OPENENV_DATASETS     comma-separated dataset specs (HF repo id, local dir, harbor name@version)
    OPENENV_LLM_URL      DEFAULT OpenAI-spec endpoint; optional, since rollouts may name their own
    OPENENV_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS  cap on what an agent may request per turn (default 8192)
    OPENENV_MODEL        served model id; read from the engine when it serves exactly one
    OPENENV_LLM_API_KEY  credential for a hosted endpoint; a Space SECRET, never a variable
    OPENENV_LLM_AUTH_HEADER  header to send it under, when not `Authorization`
    E2B_API_KEY / MODAL_TOKEN_ID+MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET   whichever sandboxes you want offered

OPENENV_LLM_URL is OPTIONAL. With no engine the server still comes up serving its datasets, and each
rollout names the engine it wants (`run_rollout(llm_url=...)`), which is probed once and cached. That
is the useful way round: a dataset tree is thousands of files and prebuilt sandbox templates, while an
engine restarts every training run — and a train-tier engine and an eval-tier one are usually both
wanted against the same task suite.

Naming an engine here still works and makes it the default for rollouts that name none.

An endpoint that cannot return token ids is not a boot failure either: the Space comes up as an EVAL
deployment, which is what a hosted provider can honestly offer. `capture_level` says which it is, and
the UI shows it.

The capture proxy rides on this same app rather than on a second port. A Space publishes exactly one
port and one URL, so the proxy is mounted at `/capture` and the sandbox reaches it at
`https://<space>.hf.space/capture`. Nothing is forwarded and no second listener is opened.
