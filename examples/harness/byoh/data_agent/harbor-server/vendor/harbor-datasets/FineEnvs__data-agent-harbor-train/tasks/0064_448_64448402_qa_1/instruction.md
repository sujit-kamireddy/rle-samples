Question:
What is the mean and standard deviation of the wine features after applying standard scaling in the dataset?

Work it out step by step — inspect the data first (head, shape, dtypes), then compute.

Answer as: mean=<value>, <label1>=<value> (comma-separated, label first, keep decimals).

Answer with a single clean value: a bare number (no commas or units, e.g. 95293), a short label, yes/no, or a comma-separated list. Keep decimal precision. If there's no applicable answer, write: Not Applicable

Write only that value to /workdir/answer.txt (e.g. `echo -n "<value>" > /workdir/answer.txt`), then stop.
